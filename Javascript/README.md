CREATED BY TIFFANY XIAO

As part of the Javascript unit for our class, I decided to create a very simple game to show the girls the capabilities of Javascript. When we initially introduced Javascript to the girls, they did not understand the potential uses for Javascript. We had started the class with Python and had not introduced graphics and canvases. I thought this game would be a great way to introduce these ideas to the girls (and it was a hit with the class). After showing the girls how to create their very first Javascript game, they were incredibly excited to possibly create more games in the future.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM:
The program is a very simple catching ball program. It is based on my final project for my own Introduction to Computer Science (although I did it in Python). The user moves a paddle and catches the ball. Each catch will increment the score by one. Failure to catch the ball will cause it to reappear at the top.

THINGS MISSING:
Since this is the girls' very first assignment concerning games, there are some intentional things missing, including:
-the paddle does not have boundaries (can end up off screen)
-there is no endgame goal (it can theoretically go on forever)
