# PROJECTS IN THIS FOLDER:
1. Calculator
  A simple python program to teach the girls the use of functions. There are two files - a bad calculator (named badcalculator.py) to illustrate the importance of using functions in code, and a good calculator (named calculator.py).
2. Recipe Box
  This project is used to teach the girls how to use dictionaries and lists. The first file "recipebox.py" is a simple program that prints out the recipe utilizing dictionaries and lists. "recipebox_multiple.py" shows the students how they could store and utilize multiple recipes with classes, with a touch of user input. The final file "recipebox_userinputs.py" teaches the girls how to successfully add recipes with user input.
